## [AnTar MIC74 Arduino Library](https://pu2clr.github.io/MCP23008/)

It is an Arduino Library to control the MIC74 8-Bit I/O Expander. 

The MIC74 device provides 8-bit, general purpose, parallel I/O expansion. It can be controlled via I²C bus applications. It is a great and inexpensive device that allow you to add more peripherals to be controlled by your Arduino board via I²C protocol.

Some Arduino projects may require more pins than the Arduino actually has. In these cases, you can use up to 8 MIC74 devices using only the I²C bus (two Arduino pins) and add up to 64 input / output ports to your project.
